## About the project
In this project I wanted to put my clean coding knowledge to the test by building a calculator application while adhering to SOLID and clean code principles. I made use of strategy pattern and factory pattern in the calculator library. For the console UI I utilized the chain of responsibility pattern to handle user input.

## Quick start
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the CleanCodeCalc.Console folder in a terminal and run a dotnet build command 
3. Navigate to the executable located in the bin folder and run it

### Features and limitation
Just input the calculation you would like to make and watch it calculate it as you type! The calculator only supports the four basic arithmetic operations: +, -, * and /.
